Hey, Iâ€™m Krystian!

ðŸ’» Full-stack wizard:
I build things that make the internet better, faster, and cooler.
From crafting seamless React components to designing backends that just work,
Iâ€™m all about clean, maintainable code.

ðŸŽ¨ The tech I speak:
- React & TypeScript: My bread and butter.
- Node.js: Where the magic happens.
- TRPC, GraphQL, REST, MongoDB, Redis: The tools I use to make data dance.

âœ¨ What Iâ€™ve done:
- Built apps for 200,000+ users without breaking a sweat (or production).
- Reduced page load times from 8 seconds to under 1â€”because lifeâ€™s too short to wait for slow pages.
- My CI pipeline went from 13 minutes to 1. (Itâ€™s okay to be impressed. I am too.)
- Refactored and optimized codebases, removing thousands of lines of clutter to make future developers smile.

ðŸ”¥ Why I code:
Coding isnâ€™t just a job - itâ€™s like being a chef, architect, and detective rolled into one.
Whether itâ€™s debugging tricky issues or designing sleek interfaces, I love bringing ideas to life with code.

ðŸ“– The next chapter:
Whether itâ€™s a big idea or a small feature, Iâ€™m here to make it awesome, one line of code at a time.
